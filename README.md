# C Modules Repository

Welcome to the C Modules Repository! This repository contains a collection of modules written in C, each providing different functionalities such as hash table, queue, and stack implementations.

** Introduction

This repository aims to provide reusable and efficient C modules for common data structures and algorithms.

** Modules Overview

Currently, the repository includes the following modules:

- *Hash Table*: Provides a hash table data structure for storing key-value pairs.
- *Queue*: Implements a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue data structure.
- *Stack*: Implements a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stack data structure.

Each module is designed to be independent and can be used separately or in combination with others, depending on your project requirements.

** Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- *utils/*: Contains the source code for each module and the makefile for compiling the library.
- *lib/*: Contains the compiled library generated from the modules.
- *tests/*: Includes extensive test programs for all modules to ensure their correctness and reliability.

** Building the Library

To build the library, navigate to the *utils/* directory and run the makefile. The compiled library will be generated in the *lib/* directory.

** Running Tests

To run the test programs for each module, navigate to the respective *tests/* directory and compile the test programs using your preferred compiler. Then, run the compiled test programs to review the test results and ensure the correctness and reliability of the modules.
